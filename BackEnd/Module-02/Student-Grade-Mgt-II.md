# Student Grade Management System

## Project Overview

**Complexity:** Medium
**Time Estimate:** 10 hours
**Technology Stack:** Java 21 (LTS), IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

Build a console-based Project/Task Management System where users can create projects, add and assign tasks, record task completion status, and calculate completion averages.

This lab focuses on core Java programming and object-oriented principles while storing all data in-memory using arrays (no databases or external dependencies).

This project forms the foundation for a progressive multi-week Project Management system.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Design console-based Java applications
* Apply OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
* Use arrays, loops, and conditionals for in-memory data handling
* Implement abstract classes and interfaces
* Demonstrate method overloading and overriding
* Build menu-driven applications with validation
* Compute completion percentages from task data

## Console UI Examples

### Main Menu

```
JAVA PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Current User: Alice Johnson (Admin)

1. Manage Projects
2. Manage Tasks
3. View Reports
4. Switch User
5. Exit
```

### Project Catalog

| ID   | Name           | Type     | Team Size | Budget  |
| ---- | -------------- | -------- | --------- | ------- |
| P001 | Alpha Tracker  | Software | 5         | $15,000 |
| P002 | IoT Sensor Kit | Hardware | 3         | $10,000 |

---

### Project Details

| Task ID | Task Name       | Status      |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| T001    | Design Database | Completed   |
| T002    | API Development | In Progress |
| T003    | Unit Tests      | Pending     |

Completion Rate: **33%**

---

### Status Report

| Project ID | Name           | Tasks | Completed | Progress |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| P001       | Alpha Tracker  | 4     | 3         | 75%      |
| P002       | IoT Sensor Kit | 2     | 1         | 50%      |

**Average Completion: 62.5%**

## Input Validation Examples

| Input                 | Error Message                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| XYZ (invalid ID)      | Invalid input. Use P001 format       |
| Done (invalid status) | Choose Pending/In Progress/Completed |
| -3 team size          | Must be greater than 0               |
