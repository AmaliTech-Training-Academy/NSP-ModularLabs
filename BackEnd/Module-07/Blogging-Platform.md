# Spring Security

---

## Blogging Platform

---

### Project Overview

This phase of the Blogging Platform emphasizes building secure, scalable, and production-ready web backends that can safely handle authentication, authorization, and cross-origin requests. Learners will apply Spring Security concepts to secure REST and GraphQL APIs using JWT-based authentication, Google OAuth2 login, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Additionally, this phase explores security-related Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts such as hashing, encryption, and secure token validation to enhance data protection and access integrity.

---

### Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

- Apply Spring Security configurations to enforce authentication, authorization, and access control across REST and GraphQL endpoints
- Implement JWT authentication, Google OAuth2 login, and secure password hashing using BCrypt
- Configure and analyze CORS and CSRF policies for different clients (Postman, browsers, and JavaFX)
- Apply DSA principles such as hashing, encryption, and token validation to strengthen security and session management
- Develop and test Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure endpoint communication for real-world deployment

---

### Epics and User Stories

#### Epic 1: Security Configuration and Access Policies

**User Story 1.1**

> As a developer, I want to configure Spring Security filters so that I can protect all endpoints and define which resources require authentication.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `SecurityFilterChain` configured with custom access rules
- Public endpoints (login, registration) and restricted endpoints (admin, author, reader) defined
- Passwords securely stored using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`

**User Story 1.2**

> As a frontend developer, I want to enable secure cross-origin requests so that external clients (e.g., React, JavaFX) can interact safely with the backend.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Global CORS configuration allows specific origins, methods, and headers
- Tested with both Postman and a web frontend
- Unauthorized origins correctly blocked with appropriate response codes

---

#### Epic 2: JWT-Based Authentication

**User Story 2.1**

> As a user, I want to log in with valid credentials and receive a JWT token so that I can securely access protected endpoints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/auth/login` endpoint generates signed JWTs with claims (username, roles, expiry)
- Tokens validated for each protected request
- Expired or tampered tokens rejected with `401 Unauthorized`

**User Story 2.2**

> As a system analyst, I want to verify token structure and claims so that I can validate authentication mechanisms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JWT includes subject, issue time, and expiration claims
- Signed using HMAC SHA-256 or RSA algorithms
- Token payload can be decoded and verified in Postman

---

#### Epic 3: CSRF and Session Security

- Endpoints secured using `@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` annotations
- Role-based access verified through Postman tests

---

#### Epic 5: DSA and Security Optimization

**User Story 5.1**

> As a developer, I want to apply DSA principles to improve security and authentication efficiency.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Hashing used for password storage and token verification
- Caching or lookup map implemented for temporary token blacklisting
- In-memory hash map used for revoked tokens or active session tracking

**User Story 5.2**
