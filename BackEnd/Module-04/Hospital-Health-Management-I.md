## Hospital/Healthcare Management System

---

### Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

- Design and normalize a relational database schema that models a hospital management domain effectively
- Develop conceptual, logical, and physical database models to ensure scalability and maintainability
- Implement CRUD operations and complex queries using SQL and JDBC
- Apply indexing, hashing, searching, and sorting algorithms to optimize database access
- Integrate database operations into a JavaFX application interface for practical interaction
- Compare relational and NoSQL designs for unstructured data storage such as patient notes or medical logs
- Measure and document performance improvement through optimization and indexing

---

### Project Overview

This stage of the Hospital Management System focuses on building the data layer and persistence logic that will power the full application in later modules. Students will design a relational database for a hospital management system, implement the schema using SQL, and integrate it with a JavaFX application that performs essential operations — including patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, and reporting.

The system must reflect real-world hospital logic (patients, doctors, departments, appointments, prescriptions, medical inventory) while incorporating data structure and algorithm concepts (caching, indexing, sorting, searching) to enhance performance.
