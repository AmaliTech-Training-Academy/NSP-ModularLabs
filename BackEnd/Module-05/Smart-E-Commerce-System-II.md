# Smart E-Commerce System – Spring Web

## Complexity

Advanced | Time Estimate: 10–12 hours

---

## Project Overview

This phase transforms the Smart E-Commerce System into a full **Spring Boot web application**, focusing on building **RESTful and GraphQL APIs**. The system applies enterprise-level backend concepts including validation, exception handling, AOP, and API documentation.

The goal is to evolve the existing database foundation into a scalable, modular, and well-documented backend system using Spring Boot.

---

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

* Apply Spring Boot configuration principles, IoC, and Dependency Injection to build modular applications.
* Develop RESTful APIs using layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).
* Implement validation, exception handling, and API documentation using Bean Validation, @ControllerAdvice, and Springdoc OpenAPI.
* Integrate GraphQL schemas, queries, and mutations for flexible data retrieval.
* Apply AOP and algorithmic techniques for logging, monitoring, sorting, searching, and pagination.
