# Spring Web


## Blogging Platform
---

### Project Overview

This phase of the Blogging Platform transforms the existing database foundation into a web-based Spring Boot application and applies Spring Web development concepts to design and implement RESTful and GraphQL APIs that interact with the system's data while applying validation, exception handling, AOP, and OpenAPI documentation.

Learners will build APIs for managing users, blog posts, comments, tags, and reviews. They will use Spring Boot's layered architecture and integrate AOP for logging and performance monitoring.

This phase also introduces algorithmic techniques for efficient sorting, searching, and pagination of blog data to support scalable content delivery.

---

### Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

- Apply Spring Boot configuration principles, IoC, and Dependency Injection to build modular and maintainable web applications
- Develop RESTful APIs using layered architecture (`Controller → Service → Repository`) with structured responses and configuration profiles
- Implement validation, exception handling, and API documentation using Bean Validation, `@ControllerAdvice`, and Springdoc OpenAPI
- Integrate GraphQL schemas, queries, and mutations for flexible data retrieval alongside REST endpoints
- Apply Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and algorithmic techniques for logging, monitoring, sorting, searching, and pagination
