## Bank Account Management
---

### Project Overview

This lab builds directly on Week 2, enhancing the Bank Account Management System by introducing modern Java features:

- Migration from arrays to **Java Collections** for more efficient, scalable data management
- Integration of **Functional Programming** (Lambdas, Functional Interfaces, Method References, Streams API) for concise, functional-style data processing
- Implementation of **File I/O and NIO** (Path API) for persistent storage of accounts and transactions
- Use of **Regular Expressions (Regex)** for validating inputs (account numbers, emails, etc.)
- Introduction to **Concurrency Fundamentals** with threads and synchronized methods for thread-safe transactions

All data is now managed in-memory using Collections and processed via functional streams, then saved/loaded from text files. This lab prepares the foundation for future persistence using databases and multi-threaded service simulations.

---

### Learning Objectives

### New Architecture Requirements

#### Collections Framework Design

**Student Management:**
```java
HashMap<String, Student> studentMap      // O(1) lookup by student ID
TreeMap<Double, List<Student>> gpaRankings // Auto-sorted by GPA
ArrayList<Student> studentList            // Maintains insertion order
HashSet<String> uniqueCourses             // O(1) membership testing
```

**Grade Management:**
```java
LinkedList<Grade> gradeHistory             // Per student, chronological
TreeMap<String, List<Grade>> subjectGrades // Organized by subject (sorted)
ConcurrentHashMap<String, Statistics> statsCache // Thread-safe cache
```

**Task Management:**
```java
PriorityQueue<Task> taskQueue              // Tasks ordered by priority
ConcurrentLinkedQueue<AuditEntry> auditLog // Thread-safe, non-blocking
```

#### Thread Safety Requirements

- Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for concurrent student lookups; synchronize modification operations
- Use `synchronized` blocks around file write operations; implement file locking for concurrent access
- Use `AtomicInteger` for counters; `AtomicLong` for timestamps
- Always use try-with-resources for `ExecutorService`; implement proper shutdown hooks

#### Executor Framework Usage

| Pool Type | Configuration | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed Thread Pool | `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5)` | Batch report generation (CPU-bound) |
| Cached Thread Pool | `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()` | On-demand statistics (short-lived) |
| Scheduled Thread Pool | `Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(3)` | Recurring background tasks |
| Single Thread Executor | `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()` | Sequential log file writing |

#### NIO.2 File Operations

```java
// Streaming large CSV files (memory efficient)
Files.lines(path)                             // Returns Stream<String>

// Buffered writing
Files.newBufferedWriter(path, StandardOpenOption.CREATE)

// Directory watching
WatchService watcher = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService()
```

#### Regex Pattern Design

```java
public class ValidationPatterns {
    public static final Pattern STUDENT_ID = Pattern.compile("STU\\d{3}");
    public static final Pattern EMAIL = Pattern.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$");
    // All patterns compiled once as static final and reused
}
```

## Module 3.3: Task Management System

**Complexity:** Medium
**Time Estimate:** 6–8 hours
**Technology Stack:** Java 21 (LTS), IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, JUnit 5

---

### Project Overview

In this lab, you will extend the Project/Task Management System from Week 2 by introducing advanced Java concepts — Collections, Functional Programming, File I/O (NIO), Regex, and Concurrency — to make the system more dynamic, expressive, persistent, and concurrent.

You will:
- Refactor Week 2's array-based logic into Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`) for flexibility
- Integrate Functional Programming constructs (Lambdas, Streams, Functional Interfaces, Method References) to process and transform collection data more efficiently
- Add File I/O to persist projects and tasks
- Use Regex for input validation
- Implement basic concurrency to simulate simultaneous task updates

All data is stored in-memory during runtime but also saved and loaded from simple JSON-like text files. This lab prepares you for Week 4, where you'll transition from file storage to databases.

---

### Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Refactor array-based logic to use Java Collections Framework (`List`, `Map`, `Set`)
- Implement functional programming with Lambdas, Functional Interfaces, and Method References
- Use the Streams API to perform filtering, mapping, and reduction operations on collections
- Implement file persistence with `java.nio.file.Files` and `Paths`
- Validate user inputs using regular expressions (`Pattern`, `Matcher`)
- Apply basic concurrency with `Thread`, `Runnable`, and `synchronized`
- Handle checked exceptions using try-with-resources for clean resource management
- Write and extend JUnit 5 tests for persistence, functional, and concurrent operations
- Maintain code quality through consistent naming, SOLID principles, and Git branching

---

### System Features Overview

#### Feature 1: Project Catalog with Collections and Streams
- Use `HashMap<String, Project>` to store and access projects
- Dynamically add/remove projects without array size limits
- Use Streams API to filter, sort, and aggregate project information
- Use Lambdas for concise iteration and data transformation

#### Feature 2: Task Management with Regex and Functional Validation
- Store tasks in `ArrayList<Task>` per project
- Enforce task ID pattern `T\d{3}` (e.g., T001)
- Validate all inputs using Regex before processing
- Implement `Predicate` or custom functional interfaces for filtering and validating task data

#### Feature 3: File Persistence (I/O with NIO)
- Save all projects and tasks to `projects_data.json` on exit
- Auto-load the file on startup using `Files.readAllLines()`
- Handle missing files and malformed data gracefully
- Use functional-style reading/writing with `Files.lines()` and stream processing

#### Feature 4: Concurrent and Functional Task Updates
- Simulate multi-user task updates with multiple threads
- Use `synchronized` methods to ensure thread safety
- Employ parallel streams or executor services for parallel updates
- Display progress as updates occur concurrently

#### Feature 5: Enhanced Testing & Git Integration
- Add JUnit tests for collection behaviors, Streams, file I/O, and threading
- Create Git branches for new features (e.g., `feature/file-io`)
- Commit with descriptive messages after major milestones

### Console UI Examples

#### Application Startup & File Load

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     JAVA PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM v3.0    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝
Loading projects from file...
✓ 5 projects loaded successfully from projects_data.json
```

#### Project Catalog (using HashMap and Streams)

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ID    | PROJECT NAME     | TYPE       | TASKS | COMPLETED (%)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
P001  | Alpha Tracker    | Software   |  5    |  80%
P002  | IoT Sensor Kit   | Hardware   |  3    |  50%
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Filter completed projects using Streams:
```java
projects.values().stream()
    .filter(p -> p.getCompletionRate() > 70)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

#### Adding Task with Regex and Functional Validation

```
Enter new task ID: TX01
❌ Error: Invalid Task ID format. Use pattern T### (e.g., T001)
Enter new task ID: T004
Enter task name: Write Unit Tests
✓ Task "Write Unit Tests" added successfully.
```

#### Saving Data to File

```
Saving project data...
Data written to projects_data.json successfully!
```

**Example `projects_data.json`:**
```json
[
  {
    "projectId": "P001",
    "name": "Alpha Tracker",
    "type": "Software",
    "tasks": [
      {"id": "T001", "name": "Design DB", "status": "Completed"},
      {"id": "T002", "name": "Implement API", "status": "In Progress"}
    ]
  },
  {
    "projectId": "P002",
    "name": "IoT Sensor Kit",
    "type": "Hardware",
    "tasks": [
      {"id": "T003", "name": "Build Prototype", "status": "Completed"}
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Concurrent Task Updates Example

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     PARALLEL TASK UPDATE SIMULATION        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝
Starting 3 threads...
Thread-1 updating T001 -> In Progress
Thread-2 updating T002 -> Completed
Thread-3 updating T003 -> Completed
All threads finished successfully.
✓ Task updates applied concurrently and safely.
```

#### JUnit Test Example

```java
@Test
void testFilterCompletedTasksUsingStreams() {
    List<Task> tasks = List.of(
        new Task("T001", "Design UI", "Completed"),
        new Task("T002", "Write Tests", "Pending")
    );
    long completed = tasks.stream()
        .filter(t -> t.getStatus().equals("Completed"))
        .count();
    assertEquals(1, completed);
}
```

#### File Error Handling

```
❌ Error: Unable to load projects_data.json (File not found)
→ Starting with empty catalog.
```

---

### Expected User Workflows

**Workflow 1: Startup and File Load**
System reads `projects_data.json` → displays number of projects loaded → proceeds to Main Menu.

**Workflow 2: Add Task with Regex and Functional Validation**
User inputs task ID → Regex ensures correct format (`T###`) → functional validation confirms uniqueness → task added on success.

**Workflow 3: Save and Exit**
User selects "Exit" → system serializes all data to file → confirms successful write.

**Workflow 4: Concurrent and Functional Task Update**
User triggers "Simulate Concurrent Updates" → threads or parallel streams update tasks → progress shown until all threads complete safely.

---
