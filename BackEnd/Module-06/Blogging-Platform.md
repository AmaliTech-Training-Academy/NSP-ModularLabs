### Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

- Apply Spring Data JPA to simplify and abstract database access using repositories
- Implement CRUD, pagination, and sorting using built-in repository methods and query derivation
- Manage transactions effectively with `@Transactional` and understand propagation and isolation levels
- Create custom JPQL and native SQL queries for complex blog-related operations
